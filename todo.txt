what needs to be done in order to make a rhythm game


basics
- spawning tiles (notes) that can be clicked to remove them
- if tile is on receptor tile then play sound + add to score
- missing too many tiles will end the game

technical requirements
- collision detection between note and receptor
- something that reads a beatmap to create notes in the right order
- holy grail: script that creates a beatmap based on any song
